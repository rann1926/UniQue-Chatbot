                "The history of BatStateU ARASOF-Nasugbu Campus dates back over 70 years. It was established by Republic Act 685, passed in 1952 through the efforts of Congressman Apolinario Reyes Apacible and Bureau of Fisheries Director Deogracias V. Villadolid. Initially called the Philippine Institute of Fisheries Technology, the school started operating in 1957 under the name Batangas School of Fisheries (BSF), with a two-story building constructed on a three-hectare land donated by Roxas y Cia.\n\nThrough the years, the school expanded its academic offerings, starting with a secondary fisheries curriculum. In 1972, it began offering a Diploma in Fishery Technology, followed by a Bachelor of Science in Fishery Education in the late 1970s.\n\nIn the 1980s, the school was renamed Apolinario R. Apacible School of Fisheries (ARASOF) and started offering elementary education, non-traditional courses, and short-term programs. By 1994, ARASOF was placed under the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), enabling the introduction of more programs such as Bachelor of Science in Food Technology, Hotel and Restaurant Management, and Education.\n\nIn 2000, ARASOF became part of Batangas State University (BatStateU) through the integration of the Pablo Borbon Memorial Institute of Technology, with ARASOF becoming one of the university's campuses. This transition led to the creation of BatStateU ARASOF-Nasugbu Campus under Republic Act 9045 in 2001.\n\nToday, BatStateU ARASOF-Nasugbu continues to grow, offering a range of multidisciplinary programs. The campus is home to over 7,000 students, with six colleges and a laboratory school, continuing its mission of academic excellence and contributing to the local community and region."
